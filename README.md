# Welcome to my Scholarship Project for 2023

## Project Proposal

#### Purpose of the outcome;

A website framework in which students can sign in and out rental devices based on a device barcode and student ID, which provides full autonomy for MRs Gamil and the other learning support teachers, who take time out of their work in order to manually log students signing in and out devices. 

#### My digital outcome will outline the following features;

- A website framework hosted online to be used by potentially several teacher at once on different platforms
- Simple and accessible UI for easy pickup use by new teachers
- Ability to create or remove new devices
- Student ID database used to correlate student with their ID - (potential Kamar integration)
- Rental logs which display all relevant data to teachers
- Data analysis of rental statistics, and downloadable data of rental logs
- Ability to add new teachers and moderators
- Ability to manually add device rental logs
- Ability to report errors or issues 

#### This project may use the following programs / languages

- Written using VSCode
- Utilising website hosting service
- Form of SQL
- HTML
- Javascript
- CSS
- PHP

- Python
Further in development of this project may refine or change the languages used to craft this outcome
