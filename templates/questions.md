Questions To Ask:
- Should it be recorded how many times a device has been rented
- How many digits is each device ID
- Is there a way that barcodes/device ID's are generated - if so what is the format
- Can two different device types have an identical device ID
- What is the preferred method to return a device - scan student ID and it automatically finds what device was rented - and if error occurs it asks for device barcode to be scanned too
