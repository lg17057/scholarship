I have started work with the table and sorting it, and selecting a date and it taking the user to the url of that date
The date format is now - dd-mm H-M instead of YY-MM-DD H-M


Fixed an issue where the submitted_under was not represented in the table and so the items were displaced by 1 

date selection now working
