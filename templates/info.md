I have started work with the table and sorting it, and selecting a date and it taking the user to the url of that date
The date format is now - dd-mm H-M instead of YY-MM-DD H-M


Fixed an issue where the submitted_under was not represented in the table and so the items were displaced by 1 

date selection now working

created check for if the user selects a date and there is no data for that date
note that the date selection still works if there is an hour and minute recorded
